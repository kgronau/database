# Lab 1 - Introduction and Overview

## About this Workshop
In this Database Patching lab you will make yourself familiar with the options of a completely unattended installation including patches. Then you'll do out-of-place patching of database with AutoUpgrade. The final step in contrast will be an in-place patching operation causing more downtime.

The patching does include not only a Release Update (RU) but also the Oracle Java Virtual Machine Bundle (OJVM), a Monthly Recommended Patch (MRP) and the Data Pump Bundle Patch (DPBP). You will cleanup, and you will do a rollback to the previous bundle as well.
